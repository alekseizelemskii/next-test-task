We want to support SSR in our application. As the most simple solution, use Next.js because it supports SSR out of the box
User interface should be built with styled-components
Make sure to use React hooks everywhere instead of class-based components
Redux as data layer with any middlewares set you to prefer
The project should have clear README with steps to run it
Network request handled with axios
Use functional programming if you are know-how. Ramda.js or lodash/fp is plus to your score
